# ExactDiagProject

This is my final project for the exact diagonalization module. It can be found in the IPYNB file with more description. The .txt files contain the current sets of data to enable closing and reopening the project without losing the progress. Time contains the timesteps, store the entropies of the systems and Psi contains the current state vector.

Better not open these files in the repository because the data is stored in different lines, so the state vector with its 2^20 entries has a million lines.
